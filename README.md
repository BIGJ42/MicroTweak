MicroTweak is designed to be a straightforward, user-friendly panel that puts customization and configuration settings right at your fingertips.

Imagine a small, neat control center embedded within your favorite Python tools or applications, allowing you to easily adjust preferences, toggle features, or input specific details without needing any technical know-how. That's the goal of MicroTweak!

## âœ¨ What MicroTweak Aims to Offer

*   **Clear & Simple Interface:** A clean, intuitive way to see and change settings. No more guesswork!
*   **Organized Options:** Settings are presented logically, often grouped by what they do, making them easy to find.
*   **Effortless Adjustments:** Use simple controls like on/off switches, dropdown menus, text boxes, and sliders to make your changes.
*   **Your Preferences, Remembered:** MicroTweak helps applications save your chosen settings so they're ready for you next time.
*   **For Any Application (Almost!):** While written in Python, the idea is to provide a way for developers to easily add a settings panel to many kinds of applications.
*   **Lightweight & Unobtrusive:** Designed to be a small helper, not a bulky addition.

## ðŸ’¬ Stay Tuned & Get Involved!

MicroTweak is a project aimed at making software more user-friendly. While this README is light on technical details right now, we're excited about building a tool that's both powerful and easy to use.

*   Have ideas or feedback on what would make a great configuration panel?
*   Interested in seeing how it develops?

Keep an eye on this space for updates! We believe that good configuration tools can significantly improve the user experience of any software.

## ðŸ“œ License

MicroTweak is planned as an open-source project, likely to be available under the MIT License. This means it will be free to use and modify.
